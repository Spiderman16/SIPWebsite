    <p>This project works with a glove that scores each team with the fingers help up by a ref. </p>
    <p>The glove can be connected via Bluetooth to any device with the program that keeps track of scores.</p>
    <p>This works by the ref using his hand and fingers to give points to teams.</p>
    <p>The coding is in C++ combined with the link from a rasberry pi 4. So a little of python also.</p>
